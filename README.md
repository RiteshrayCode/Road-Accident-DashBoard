# Road-Accident-DashBoard
This project presents an interactive Road Accident Dashboard built in Tableau with demo data to showcase its visualization and filtering capabilities. The dashboard offers a clear view of accident data across key metrics, including casualties by year, vehicle type, and location.
# Key Features
# Casualty Analysis by Year: 
View annual casualty trends with a flexible year filter, enabling quick adjustments for comparative analysis over time.
# Vehicle Type Insights:
Break down casualty data by vehicle type, allowing users to observe patterns in accidents involving different types of vehicles. This feature is especially useful for identifying high-risk vehicle categories over selected years.
# Location-Based Filtering:
Easily view accident data by specific locations to understand geographic patterns in casualty distribution. This spatial element adds another layer of insight, making it possible to track accident-prone areas.
# Real-Time Data Filtering:
The dashboard supports real-time filtering, allowing users to adjust key parameters instantly. By selecting different years or vehicle types, users can explore accident data dynamically without having to reset or reload.
# User-Friendly Interface:
Designed with interactivity in mind, the dashboard’s layout and filtering options make it simple for users of any level to navigate and uncover insights from the data.
# Potential Applications
While this project uses demo data, it provides a strong foundation for analyzing real-world accident data. The dashboard can serve as a valuable tool for understanding casualty patterns and trends over time, which could be useful in various contexts, such as traffic management, research, and reporting. However, it’s important to note that this dashboard is intended as a demo and does not include strategies or recommendations for road safety improvement.

# Installation and Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and open the Tableau workbook file (.twb or .twbx) in Tableau Desktop. Once open, users can interact with the dashboard as described above. This demo is ideal for those looking to explore Tableau’s interactive features in the context of a practical, data-driven project.
